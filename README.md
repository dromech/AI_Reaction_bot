# AI_Reaction_bot
This was a passion project that automated Instagram “cat reaction” videos. It scraped meme clips, analyzed frames with AI, generated scripts in the voices of Sunny and Dusty, voiced them with Amazon Polly, and overlaid subtitles, images, and sounds. Once fully working, it’s now broken but remains a fun creative experiment.
